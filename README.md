# Usage

To create picker you can use `ImagePickerController` class.
```swift
let imagePickerController = ImagePickerController { (selectedAssets: [PHAsset]?) in
  print("Selected assets: \(selectedAssets.debugDescription)")
}
viewController.present(imagePickerController, animated: true, completion: nil)
 ```
 
To override theme of the `ImagePickerController` you can pass `Theme` in consturctor:
```swift
let theme = Theme(
  font: Theme.Font(
    body: UIFont.preferredFont(forTextStyle: .body)
  ),
  color: Theme.Color(
    navigationBar: .systemGray,
    background: .white,
    foreground: .black,
    foregroundLight: .systemGray,
    accent: .systemBlue,
    selectionStroke: .white,
    selectionShadow: .black
  )
)
   
 let picker = ImagePickerController(theme: theme, handler: onPick(assets:))
```

# Swift Package Manager
The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding `ImagePicker` as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your `Package.swift`:

### Swift 5
```
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/achernoprudov/image-picker.git", from: "0.0.2")
]
```
